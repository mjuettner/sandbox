# Playing with Puppet

## Prerequisites
- Create a new EC2 Key Pair, we'll assume it's named 'puppet'

## Build
- Deploy the vpc.yaml CloudFormation template to create a basic network infrastructure.  We're going to be lazy and put the EC2 instances in the public subnet(s), so you don't have to
have a NAT Gateway
